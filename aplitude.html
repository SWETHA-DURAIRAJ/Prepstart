<h3>How Aptitude Tests Are Marked</h3>
<p><br>Aptitude tests are norm referenced.
This means that your performance on the test will be compared to a “norm group.”
A norm group is a group of people with similar characteristics to the candidate, a group of graduate trainees for example.</p>
<p><br>Your score will be compared to the scores of the people in the norm group, and this will allow the assessor to understand your performance relative to others who are similar to you.</p>
<p><br>Usually, a candidate’s score is expressed as a percentile.
This, then, tells the assessor what percentage of the norm group their performance surpassed.
If a candidate scored on the 75th percentile, for example, they have performed better than 75 percent of the norm group.</p>
<p><br>Each particular employer may have a different performance level required for specific positions.
To be successful, the candidate must achieve a level of performance that exceeds a stated minimum.
Candidates will usually not know what the minimum score requirement is before they take an aptitude test.</p>
<h3>SCORES AND MARKING</h3>
<p><br>Your score relates your performance to an average group. Your aptitude, ability or intelligence has a relative value to this average result.
An ‘average’ performance is all that is required to pass an aptitude test.
Most employers take people’s backgrounds into consideration for marking.</p>
<h2>NEGATIVE MARKING</h2>
<p><br>Many aptitude tests incorporate negative marking. This means that for every answer you give incorrectly, a mark will be deducted from your total (rather than scoring no mark). If this is the case, you will normally be told beforehand.In any test that does incorporate negative marking, you must not guess answers, even if you are under extreme time pressure, as you will undo your chances of passing.</p>
<h3>TAKING THE TEST</h3>
<p><br>You should work quickly and accurately through the test.
Don’t get stuck on any particular question: should you have any problems, return to it at the end of the test. You should divide your time per question as accurately as you can – typically this will be between 50 and 90 seconds per question.</p>
<p><br>Remember that the tests are difficult and often you will not he expected to answer all the questions. Be particularly cautious if the aptitude test uses negative marking; if this is not the case, answer as many questions as possible in the time given.</p>
<p><br>Remember that multiple-choice options are often designed to mislead you, with incorrect choices including common mistakes that candidates make.</p>
<h4>TIPS:</h4>
<h3> PRACTICE IN ADVANCE</h3>
<p><br>Evidence suggests that some practice of similar aptitude tests may improve your performance in the real tests. Practice exam technique and try to become more familiar with the types of test you may face by completing practice questions.
Even basic word and number puzzles may help you become used to the comprehension and arithmetic aspects of some tests.</p>
<h3>PREPARATION BEFORE THE TEST</h3>
<p><br>Treat aptitude tests like an interview: get a good night’s sleep, plan your journey to the test site, and arrive on time and appropriately dressed. Listen to the instructions you are given and follow them precisely.</p>
<p><br>Before the actual aptitude test itself, you will almost certainly be given practice examples to try. Make sure you ask questions if anything is unclear at this stage.</p>
<p><br>You will normally be given some paper on which to make rough workings. Often you can be asked to hand these in with the test, but typically they do not form part of the assessment.</p>
