    <h1><b><center>INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:</center></b></h1>
</h2>PREPARATION AND TIPS FOR INTERVIEW:</h2>
<h3>Be positive:</h3>
<p> When preparing for an interview and anticipating likely questions, plan to answer all questions positively. “Even if you were in a bad situation, think about how you can talk about the situation positively. You always have a choice.</p>
<h3>CONFIDENT:</h3>
<p>Preparation and practice aside, the most important tip job seekers should  feel comfortable with the interview process, Feeling comfortable and relaxed positively influences your confidence. “And interviewers always appreciate a relaxed and confident candidate, as opposed to a heavy promoter and edgy one.</p>
<h3>Figure out how to articulate your goals:</h3>
<p> Most of the commonly asked questions during an interview either dig into your previous experience or want to explore your future goals, “Prepare and articulate your goals, and remain honest here.  Inconsistent answers won't get you the respect and credibility that is a must to impress an interviewer.</p>
<h3>MOST COMMON QUSTIONS ASKED IN INTERVIEW:</h3>
<p>Interviewers will ask questions about you to gain insight into your personality and to determine whether you're a fit for both the job and the company. These are open-ended questions which will give you the opportunity to show the employer that you're well-qualified for the position.</p>
<p>Here's a list of common job interview questions, with examples of the best answers about you, your work history and experience, the job, your goals, the new job, salary, and what you have to offer the employer.</p>
<h4><ul><li>Tell me about yourself<li><ul></h4>
<p>This is one of the first questions you are likely to be asked. Be prepared to talk about yourself, and why you're an ideal candidate for the job.</p>
<p>The interviewer wants to know why you're an excellent fit for the job. Try to answer questions about yourself without giving too much, or too little, personal information.</p>
<h4><ul><li>What is your greatest strength?</li></ul><h4>
<p>When you're answering this question, remember to “show” rather than “tell.” For example, rather than stating that you are an excellent problem solver, instead tell a story that demonstrates this, ideally drawing on an anecdote from your professional experience.</p>
<p> This is one of the questions that employers almost always ask to determine how well you are qualified for the position. When you are asked about your greatest strengths, it's important to discuss the attributes that qualify you for that specific job, and that will set you apart from other candidates. </p>
<h4><ul><li>What is your greatest weakness?</li></ul></h4>
<p>This question is an opportunity to show the hiring manager that you're well qualified for the job. In addition to learning whether you've got the right credentials, the hiring manager wants to know whether you can take on challenges and learn new tasks.</p>
<p>Another typical question interviewers will ask is about your weaknesses. Do your best to frame your answers around positive aspects of your skills and abilities as an employee, turning seeming “weaknesses” into strengths.</p>
<h4><ul><li>What makes you unique?</li></ul></h4>
<p>Employers often include this question to identify what skills or qualities make you a better fit for the role than other candidates they might be interviewing. In other words, if dozens of other professionals with nearly identical skill sets have also applied for the role, why should they hire you instead?</p>
<p>A second reason employers ask this question is to understand what you value about yourself. The things you emphasize in your answer may also be critical strengths you’re continually working to improve upon. The employer is looking for exceptional strengths or soft skills you might not have included in your resume or application but will help you do well on the job.</p>
<h4><ul><li>Tell me about something that's not on your resume.</li></ul></h4>
<ul><li>Stress a strength or skill that's essential to the position (and that's not on your resume)</li>
 <li>Talk about a volunteering or extracurricular experience that you can relate to the position.</li>
 <li>Mention something you accomplished at your current job that's so recent it's not on your resume</li></ul>
<h4><ul><li>How will your greatest strength help you perform?</li></ul></h4>
 	<p>Sharing skill-based strengths allow you to align your technical experience directly with the job’s qualifications. When explaining technical skills, it’s important to provide specific examples of how you’ve applied your strength to drive success for an organization. This shows the interviewer you have a thorough grasp of a primary requirement for the job and know how to apply this knowledge to real-life situations</p>
<h4>How do you handle stress and pressure?</h4>
<p>Mention skills you’ve learned from working under pressure. Dealing with stressful situations can teach you valuable skills like:</p>
<ul><li>Time management</li>
<li>Prioritization</li>
<li>Organization</l>i
<li>Diligence</li></ul>
<p>These are all soft skills that employers look for in potential employees.Using your response to this question to talk about your work-related skills and how you deal with stress will make your answer twice as good.</p>
<h3><ul><li>What motivates you?</li></ul></h3>
<ul><li>Sometimes, the best solution is, to be honest- you can say money is your motivational factor, but it should be your last option</li>
<li>Mention things like Job satisfaction, working towards a goal, contributing to a team effort, or developing your skills. Provide a specific example that supports your response</li>
<li>Excitement for new challenges</li>
<li>Quest for personal development</li>
<p>What not to say:</p>
<li>Do not mention that you are motivated by bragging rights, material things or fear of being discipline.</li></ul>
<h3><ul><li>What is your dream job? </li></ul></h3>
<p>Along similar lines, the interviewer wants to uncover whether this position is really in line with your ultimate career goals. While “an NBA star” might get you a few laughs, a better bet is to talk about your goals and ambitions—and why this job will get you closer to them.</p>
<h3><ul><li>Why should we hire you? </li></ul></h3>
<p>Now go deeper. Don't just talk about why the company would be great to work for; talk about how the position is a perfect fit for what you hope to accomplish, both short-term and long-term.
And if you don't know why the position is a perfect fit, look somewhere else. Life is too short.</p>
<h3><ul><li>What questions haven’t I asked you? </li></ul></h3>
<p>Don’t worry the question isn’t trick,if anything it’s a freebie,
This is your opportunity to show anything they haven’t touched on that you think is important that will set you apart.In particular,you’ll want to suggest questions that hint at why you’re here different and how you plan to contribute.</p>
<p>Respond with these questions:</p>
<ul><li>How did you become interested in the position?</li>
<li>What unique skills do you posses?</li>
 
<h3><ul><li>What questions do you have for me? </li></ul></h3>
 
<p>Don't waste this opportunity. Ask smart questions, not just as a way to show you're a great candidate but also to see if the company is a good fit for you -- after all, you're being interviewed, but you're also interviewing the company.</p>
